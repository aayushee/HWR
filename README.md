Trying handwriting recognition using deep learning.

Trying to implement the paper 'Unconstrained Online Handwriting Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks' by Alex Graves et al. using Keras with Theano background. [Graves, Alex, et al. "Unconstrained on-line handwriting recognition with recurrent neural networks." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2008.]

Modified the image ocr example of Keras given at :https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/image_ocr.py for this online handwriting recognition task.
